Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results."
0xc62b,50731,Image,Exif.Image.BaselineNoise,Rational,"Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image."
0xc62c,50732,Image,Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness,Rational,"Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters."
0xc62d,50733,Image,Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit,Long,"Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence)."
0xc62e,50734,Image,Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit,Rational,Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
0xc62f,50735,Image,Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber,Ascii,CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
0xc630,50736,Image,Exif.Image.LensInfo,Rational,"Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0."
0xc631,50737,Image,Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius,Rational,"ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm."
0xc632,50738,Image,Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength,Rational,"Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts)."
0xc633,50739,Image,Exif.Image.ShadowScale,SRational,This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
0xc634,50740,Image,Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData,Byte,"Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files."
0xc635,50741,Image,Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety,Short,"MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image."
0xc65a,50778,Image,Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1,Short,"The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag."
0xc65b,50779,Image,Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2,Short,"The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown)."
0xc65c,50780,Image,Exif.Image.BestQualityScale,Rational,"For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size."
0xc65d,50781,Image,Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID,Byte,"This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier."
0xc68b,50827,Image,Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName,Byte,"If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file."
0xc68c,50828,Image,Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData,Undefined,"If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks."
0xc68d,50829,Image,Exif.Image.ActiveArea,Short,"This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right."
0xc68e,50830,Image,Exif.Image.MaskedAreas,Short,"This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful."
0xc68f,50831,Image,Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile,Undefined,"This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values."
0xc690,50832,Image,Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix,SRational,"This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components."
0xc691,50833,Image,Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile,Undefined,"This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers."

The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers."
0xc6bf,50879,Image,Exif.Image.ColorimetricReference,Short,"The DNG color model documents a transform between camera colors and CIE XYZ values. This tag describes the colorimetric reference for the CIE XYZ values. 0 = The XYZ values are scene-referred. 1 = The XYZ values are output-referred, using the ICC profile perceptual dynamic range. This tag allows output-referred data to be stored in DNG files and still processed correctly by DNG readers."

0xc6f7,50935,Image,Exif.Image.NoiseReductionApplied,Rational,"This tag indicates how much noise reduction has been applied to the raw data on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. A 0.0 value indicates that no noise reduction has been applied. A 1.0 value indicates that the ""ideal"" amount of noise reduction has been applied, i.e. that the DNG reader should not apply additional noise reduction by default. A value of 0/0 indicates that this parameter is unknown."
0xc6f8,50936,Image,Exif.Image.ProfileName,Byte,A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the camera profile. This tag is optional if there is only a single camera profile stored in the file but is required for all camera profiles if there is more than one camera profile stored in the file.
